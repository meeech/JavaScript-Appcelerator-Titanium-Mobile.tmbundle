How to install
----

0. Install TextMate (um… duh?)
1. Download [JavaScript-Appcelerator-Titanium-Mobile.tmbundle.zip](http://github.com/meeech/JavaScript-Appcelerator-Titanium-Mobile.tmbundle/zipball/master)
2. Unzip
3. Rename the folder to `ti-mo.tmbundle`
    * The name of the folder doesn't really matter, just so long as it has the `tmbundle` extension
4. Double-Click
5. Install the JSON Ruby Gem
    * `sudo gem install json`
6. Enjoy!


How to use
---

### Complete! ⌥⎋ *option-escape*
The completion list contains all of the `Titanium` and `Ti` API.

### Tooltips! ⌥F1 
The tips are context sensitive. Place your caret anywhere inside of a function (on the same line) and it'll work, even inside the arguments `()`!

### Stop & Launch Emulator  ⌘R
Will stop the emulator (if it's running) and launch the project in the emulator.

### Complete! Type `Ti.` (optional)
*Enable this by selecting the "JavaScript Titanium Mobile" language in the bottom bar of TextMate.*

As soon as you hit the `.` (after typing `Ti`) it'll bring up the as-you-type completion list thing.

Note: If you are at the last line and click "." then the code completion list won't appear. You must leave a blank line at the end of your document.
